[The Face We Make Project](http://thefacewemake.org/about/) tries to reverse the process that created the emoticon: adding "feelings" to electronic communications. This project uses the photos taken by [Dexter Miranda](http://dxtr.com/#info) for the project in order to analyze if humans are able to identify the right emoticon in the picture.

The project shows you a picture of a person representing an emoticon and all you have to do is guess which emoticon is he/she representing. We will be analyzing how good are people guessing feelings and if they interpret correctly the emoticons.
