[The Face We Make Project](http://thefacewemake.org/about/) tries to reverse the process that created the emoticon: adding "feelings" to electronic communications. This application uses the photos taken by [Dexter Miranda](http://dxtr.com/#info) for the project in order to analyze if humans are able to identify the right emoticon in the picture.

The application shows you a picture of a person representing an emoticon and all you have to do is guess which emoticon is he representing. We will be analyzing how good are people guessing feelings and if they interpret correctly the emoticons.
